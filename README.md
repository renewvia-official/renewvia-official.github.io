# Phishing Prevention on a Budget
Hello! This is the repository Renewvia uses to run phishing tests on our employees. For more information, please read Nick Selby's blog post, [Phishing Prevention on a Budget: How to Test and Train Your Employees for Free](https://rupumped.github.io/phishing.html). If you are a Renewvia employee investigating a mysterious file or link sent to your email, good job; you passed a phishing test; don't follow the instructions in the email.

Please note that the API password located in `index.html` is no longer active. To create your own version of this site, I recommend setting up a free SMTP server using [Elastic Email](https://elasticemail.com/).
