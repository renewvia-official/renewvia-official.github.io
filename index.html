	<h1>Phishing Awareness Exercise</h1>
	<p>This was a simulated phishing exercise conducted by Renewvia to raise awareness about the dangers of phishing. If it had been a real phishing attempt, you would have unknowingly given your personal information to a criminal. The information below can help you recognize phishing messages.</p>

	<h2>What Happened?</h2>
	<p>You received an email that appeared to be from our CEO. The email contained suspicious elements that should have raised red flags:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A sense of urgency in the request</li>
		<li>Pressure to take immediate action</li>
		<li>A link to click, even though it was in an email you weren't expecting</li>
		<li>A slightly altered or suspicious sender email address</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You clicked on a link in the email. This could have been either the main "VIEW DOCUMENT" link or the "Click here to report this as a phishing attempt." link in the email footer. <b>Even links that appear to be security-related should not be trusted if they're within a suspicious email. Attackers often include fake security features to build trust.</b></p>

	<p>Our company policy for reporting suspicious emails is to not click any links in the suspicious email, forward the entire email to phishing@renewvia.com, and use Outlook's built-in "Report Phishing" button in the ribbon menu.</p>

	<p>To protect yourself from phishing attacks, be cautious of emails and messages that exhibit any of the following six characteristics:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A request to click on links or open attachments</li>
		<li>An unexpected attachment</li>
		<li>A sense of urgency or pressure</li>
		<li>Appeals to fear, opportunity, or curiosity</li>
		<li>Requests for sensitive data or credentials</li>
		<li>Any non-Renewvia websites asking for your Renewvia account information</li>
		<li>Unusual requests from executives or colleagues</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Always verify the sender's email address carefully and hover over links to see their true destination before clicking. When in doubt, contact the supposed sender through a different channel (phone, Teams, etc.) to verify the request. If it is not a Renewvia website, do not provide your credentials. Phishers often direct users to imitation websites that appear legitimate to steal their sensitive information.</p>
	
	<h2>Next Steps</h2>
	<p>As a result of clicking on the link, you are required to complete a cybersecurity awareness training. Please complete the training at <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://learnsecurity.amazon.com/en/index.html">https://learnsecurity.amazon.com/en/index.html</a> and send Nick your certificate of completion.</p>
