	<p>This was a simulated phishing exercise conducted by Renewvia to raise awareness about the dangers of phishing. If it had been a real phishing attempt, you would have unknowingly given your personal information to a criminal. The information below can help you recognize phishing messages.</p>

	<p>The email was sent from the address nicholas.selby@renewvia.com. However, it is important to note that the sender's email address can easily be forged, and therefore should not be fully trusted.</p>
		
	<p>If you hover your mouse over the link provided in the email, you will see that it would direct you to renewvia-official.github.io, which is not a legitimate Renewvia website. To identify the domain, look for the third forward slash (/) and read the words preceding it. In this case, the domain is github.io. It is also important to note that just because a link has an "https://" and a lock symbol in the browser does not necessarily mean that the website is safe to visit.</p>
		
	<p>To protect yourself from phishing attacks, be cautious of emails and messages that exhibit any of the following six characteristics:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A request to click on links</li>
		<li>An unexpected attachment</li>
		<li>A sense of urgency</li>
		<li>An appeal to human greed and/or fear</li>
		<li>A request for your sensitive data</li>
		<li>Any non-Renewvia websites asking for your Renewvia account information</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Always verify the URL of the website before entering your login credentials. If it is not a Renewvia website, do not provide your credentials. Phishers often direct users to imitation websites that appear legitimate to steal their sensitive information.</p>
	
	<p>If you have any doubts or concerns about an email, forward it to phishing@renewvia.com and ask Nick to verify it for you.</p>

	<p>As a result of clicking on the link, you are required to complete a cybersecurity awareness training. Please complete the training at <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://learnsecurity.amazon.com/en/index.html">https://learnsecurity.amazon.com/en/index.html</a> and send Nick your certificate of completion.</p>
